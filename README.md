## 👨‍💻🎹🌲λ FP Enthusiast, Embedded Rust Explorer & Synth Tinkerer
Hey there! I'm a software dev passionate about functional programming and currently exploring embedded systems with Rust. My FP journey spans from type-safe languages like [PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript) to the dynamic expressiveness of [Clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojure). I value how FP principles - referential transparency, composability, and expression-based code - lead to robust, maintainable software. These days, I'm excited about bringing these principles into the embedded world with Rust, where safety and performance meet.

_I have recently started to use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/michelrandahl) 🇪🇺, instead of github for new personal projects._

## Natural Habitat 🖥️
You'll typically find me in my [Linux terminal](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - it's where I live now! Armed with [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), Linux package managers and tools, and my trusty [ZSA Voyager split keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/voyager), I've built a development environment that feels like home. I enjoy keyboard-driven workflows, keeping my hands comfortably on the home row. I use [NixOs](https://nixos.org/), BTW.

## Book recommendations 📖

## Beyond Code 🌊🏃🌳🪛🎛️🎶
Away from the keyboard, my passion for creation takes different forms.

- You'll often find me lost in **music** and **sound synthesis** - playing my synths with generous amounts of reverb or experimenting with **generative** patches and curious timbres on my [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) system which I have designed and built myself and where the majority of the modules are DIY builds.
- My **soldering** iron and my [Miniware MHP30 Hot Plate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTQjTvJe_UE) are constant companions as I tackle Eurorack module builds of varying difficulty.
- I seek inspiration in **nature**. My "office" frequently relocates to the local forest and lakeside spots, and I also enjoy trail running, long walks, and occasional kayak adventures.
- Recently I have started to 'surf the skies' by flying **freestyle FPV quadcopters**.
