## λ👨‍💻🎹🌲 FP Enthusiast, Embedded Rust Explorer & Synth Tinkerer
Hey there! I'm a software dev who loves crafting elegant solutions with functional programming. You'll find me working with [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/), [F#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/fsharp) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), or lately diving into [embedded Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded) projects.

## Beyond Code 🌊
When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- 🎶⛰️ Playing my Synths with way too much reverb on, or making generative blips, blops and obnoxious noises on my homemade Eurorack system 🎛️🔊
- 🪛🎛️ Waiting for my soldering iron or mini hot-plate to get hot and building and tweaking Eurorack synth modules (20+ DIY builds and counting!)
- ⚡🔧 Getting my hands dirty with electronics repair and hardware hacking
- 🌲 Working from random spots in nature - forests and lakes are my favorite "offices"
- 🏃‍♂️🥾 🌳 Exploring trails by foot or hitting lakes in my kayak 🛶
