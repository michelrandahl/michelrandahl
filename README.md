## 👨‍💻🎹🌲λ FP Enthusiast, Embedded Rust Explorer & Synth Tinkerer
Hey there! I'm a software dev who's passionate about functional programming - from the comfort of type checked languages such as [PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript) to the dynamic expressiveness of [Clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojure). I love how expression-based code naturally leads to referential transparency and composability, making it easier to reason about and verify. I believe that when code is readable and concise and generally referential transparent, then it naturally follows that the same code is also maintainable, has fewer bugs and security vulnerabilities.

Currently I am on a journey into Embedded programming with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

_I have recently started to use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/michelrandahl) 🇪🇺, so thats where my future personal projects will reside and evolve._

## Natural Habitat 🖥️
You'll typically find me in my [Linux terminal](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - it's where I live now! Armed with [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), Linux package managers and tools, and my trusty [ZSA Voyager split keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/voyager), I've built a development environment that feels like home. I enjoy keyboard-driven workflows, navigating through my setup with the [i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) while keeping my hands comfortably on the home row. I use [NixOs](https://nixos.org/), BTW.

## Beyond Code 🌊🏃🌳🪛🎛️🎶
Away from the keyboard, my passion for creation takes different forms. You'll often find me lost in music and sound synthesis - playing my synths with generous amounts of reverb or experimenting with generative patches and curious timbres on my [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) system which I have designed and built myself, and where the majority of the modules are DIY builds. My soldering iron and my [Miniware MHP30 Hot Plate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTQjTvJe_UE) are constant companions as I tackle Eurorack module builds of varying difficulty. When I'm not tinkering with hardware or doing electronics repair, I seek inspiration in nature. My "office" frequently relocates to the local forest and lakeside spots. I also enjoy trail running, long walks, and occasional kayak adventures. These outdoor experiences keep me refreshed and grounded, and fuels my creativity both in and out of code. Recently I have also acquired an FPV drone and is now learning FPV drone acrobatic flying indoors as well as outdoors.
